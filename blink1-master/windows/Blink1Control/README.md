Compilation Notes
=================

Blink1Control currently targets x86 and .NET Framework 4.5.  
There may be a way of downgrading to .NET 4.0, but I don't know how to do it.
The x86 dependency is because of the CefSharp library, which was compiled x86.



Packaging Steps (in lieu of real installer, these are mostly notes to tod)
