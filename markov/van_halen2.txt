Wow! 
Yeah, please can you shine some light? 
Touched love? 
I'm just skin and bones 
Nothing will be scaring me, oh no 
Dream another dream, this dream is over, over yeah, (dream another dream) 
Know something to be true, then deny it 
You wanna lover, you want a friend
I fought the setting sun on my kingdom come 
Speaking day-glow red, Explodo opaque
Oh Oh Oh
Campaign promises falling short 
It's not work, that makes it work no 
When I jumped out on that road
I got 'er in my sight, but 
Of the fine, fine stuff, 
Waitin' for love to set me free 
Grown to expect, expect more of the same 
(Oh)Its just an invitation,across the nation,a chance for folks to meet. 
Ahh
Steel fingers play a deadly song.
Ohhh....... 
I got no love, no love you'd call real
I'm always a sucker for a real good time. 
Ah girl, you really got me now 
I'm overdone 
God damn it lady, you know I ain't lying to ya
She's down home and down home, 
Have no place to go, 
Ooh, Ahhh, goes like this 
Ohh there she stands in a silken gown 
Tell me you won't go, you won't go 
This dream is over, (oooh) over yeah, (dream another dream) 
and this corner is where we write the story.
Baby why can't this be love 
Heard a vicious rumor from your mama's tongue: you a desp'rate woman, need a man with a gun. 
Cause I need you,need you tonight 
In the grooves,on the go, 
If everything is coming your way
So hot, so hot, so hot 
One love, so fine 
Oh no, nothing's gonna change 
Because my heart will always be 
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around 
1-800-IT'S TIME
There's a fire in the hole 
When I flex Elvis talks
She got a doorbell sign that said:

Driving all the women crazy, only want Jimmy-baby, 
You are near
Woman all you want is good as it can get,oh yeah! 
Turn here and gone from on the go. 
And no matter what you say or do

Dream another dream 
Tramp stamp tat

Puts me under stress, oh..... 
Got the feeling, power steering, 
Feels so good, feels so nice 
I suffered ‘cause of you.
No calls
Lots of pretty girls, coming by the dozens 
Enough to kill a generation 
You can try me at home, if it feels all right 
Oh baby, come on
So when we face, face the adversary 
Holding the intangible 
It's always here and now, my friend 
But I ain't no fool and honey I know a good thing 
We're gonna feel this thing together 
Ooh, I need your love 
Ooh, I Ooh I need, got to have that love 
Forgive me father 
Don't you know that you can dance with me

And I feel her from across the room. 
Sittin 'round just getting high 
Come on baby, finish what you started
Ain't got nobody waiting at home
Another place, another time, oh 
Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo
Wait a second man. Whaddaya think the teacher's gonna look like this year ? 
In my hands 
Happy Trails to you, 
Everybody's lookin' for somethin' 
She said she's tired of watchin' me fall down. 
Drown my faith in trinity, yeah! 
I don't like nothin' in between 
Said I came to waste some time. 
Could it ever be too much? 
My love is rotten to the core 
Look into your eyes, that hint of depth 
And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town. 
(This is home) Turns you from hunted into hunter 
or what was he worth?
She said: Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble. 
I see the power, 
Dream another dream, (ooh ooh ooh) 
Don't want no class reunion. 
I just slide, slide on by, never bad enough to crucify me 
Something, I'd never imply 
Needed a girl, but I was just too lazy. 
You way too civilized. Oh, 
It's your tomorrow 
Thought you'd never miss me 
Yeah-Give it here 
Now her name is up in lights 
Now Jamie's been in love before (ahhh) 
It's the hardest thing, oh..... 
I never met a man doesn't owe somebody somethin', no 
A year to the day 
Oh really mine, all mine 
Think I'm gonna fight him? 
As long as I mail my bills and look me in the eye 
Yeah, the one I want (want) 
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome 
Pray for the mercy of the sea 
Some place to feast my eyes, oh 
It's all over but the shouting 
Just like I told you before, yeah before 
All you bad bad boys - yeah, it's a spank line, ha ha ha ha 
Two tribes warring
This dream is over, (dream another dream) 
Silver lights shining down 
Once embraced, can't ever be let go 
Sittin 'round just gettin' high 
Gimme some of that 
Son-of-a-bitch got me singin' that same old song 
Yeah, she opened up my eyes 
I'm coming straight for your heart. 
I Can't choose what's not my decision 
Run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round) 
When the night is through, will I still be loving you ? 
Ow, ow, come on and show me 
Dealin' with your troubles drove me away. 
loss of control, loss of control, loss of control! 
Seems like loving you is just a crazy dream, but do as you feel. 
Got the big deal in the back of a limo 
Ain't no match for your mean old man 
Ohhhh....... 
Better save the women and children first. 
Ah yeah! 
I'll bear the cross on Judgement Day 
A buck is still a buck in Shanghai
And it ain't gonna change overnight, no 
Well she can take me for is a little ride 
Ain't beatin', but I'm being eatin' by money, oh yeah 
Rolling like the ocean when the moon is full
Ow, I like it 
For in the end, there will be equality 
Standing on top, 
They're holding all the cards, making things so hard, before it goes too far 
I can drive 
No mercy at your feet 
Just take me down, down, down, down to the bottom 
Ah precious sweetheart, 
Pull your headphones on, I'm in your heads, ah 
Unchained, yeah you hit the ground running 
This is my chance to fly 
Pledge allegiance to a place 
I thought we were alone 
Calling out around the world,are you ready for a brand new beat. 
I get the message 
And you keep trying 
So tell me why can't this be love 
It said, "Open your eyes. Leave it all behind." 
So very autobiographic!
I'm a lucid vision
Gimme something to write on, man 
Or hang around to be born again 
yeah you, so you think you made it better 
Over the edge and here I'll stay 
Oh so full of life, so free and easy 
Doing the dishes,mopping up that floor (Yes he is) 
(Ah-ah-ah)
Shiftless and the crazy
I don't, I don't, I don't 
Catch a magic moment, do it 
Another page is turned. 
Maybe I'm crazy or just too high 
I tell you honey by morning you'll be mine, yes 
Does it seem cold in here to you? 
Reachin' out for anything, so 
Once. Whoa-oh really, really touched?
Can you shine the light? 
Goin' out my way, knowin' my way around 
One step ahead, one step behind me 
No candidate would I support 
Inhale before you begin 
I don't feel tardy 
Hey, hey, hey
(Show your love) 
We're flat stone cold lied to 
Let's get started. Let's not stop soon
No I..... 
Oh yeah you think you're really cookin' baby, you better find yourself a friend 
Feelin'....no, I don't like what I've been told I'm feelin' 
Ooh, woman and a woman, them are silly games you play, yeah. 
Dream another dream...
We're searching for the latest thing 
Yeah, don't look at me baby 
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed.
Ev'rybody wants some. 
To love somebody foolishly 
To love somebody hopelessly 
Woooo-ooooo 
Least likely to succeed 
It's hard to tell, when innocence comes and goes 
If thats the way it must be, ok 
Some only see 
Pretty maids, all in a row, go on, set 'em up, up. 
Including you 
Oh no, but I think you'll find 
Way down in LA,everyday,dancing in the streets (Dancing in the streets) 
Didn't you? 
Gayman, looking for another 
I got an open mind, do anything 
Yeah. Come on
We're just playin, clean and simple 
Right now, oh, Right now 
Now you know this ain't no through street 
And then Bill got himself a wife, 
Richman, want a little bit more 
There was a mischievous look, behind that smile? 
Pretty woman dont walk on by,Pretty woman dont make me cry, 
That number is forever like the struggle here to win
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean. 
Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine. 
And you make it harder.. 
I don't wanna hear about it later 
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that 
Something got the bite on me 
And I think I like 
We came... we came... we came through blood and fire
That's all I ever need, uh huh. 
But I like that bottle better than the rest. 
The tender touch 
Standing on top of the world 
Want my iron in that fire 
Home grown, and down home, whew! 
She wants the good life, only the best. 
Or changed the channel when you saw a hungry child? 
Once born, can't ever be not conceived 
Ain't gonna talk about love, no more, no more, ah 
Wooo-oooo-oooo 
I know the law friend. 
The underground, oh, oh 
Ain't no picture ever say it right 
Tell me what is wrong 
Got me on pins and needles 
Woman get crazy if she cant go 
I see a glow that fills this room 
Come see your children; yeah, they're lighting up the skies. 
Keep smiling on til then 
You can't imagine what your image means. 
Uh, I like it 
Seeing what I wanna see 
I like to take each step, one by one
Up and down, around and 'round 
(Ah) Looks just like an angel,but he's just talking trash 
Go ahead, jump. Jump!
When my axe cuts me deep, I let it bleed 
'Cause you know I wanna be 
Dig that steam, giant butt, makes me scream, I get nuh-nuh-nothing but the shakes over you 
To love somebody faithfully 
Be sure you're hurting long before you fly,
Just grease it up and bring on the heat 
(This is Meanstreet) Go and hunt somebody down 
A goodman, he's hard to find
Mine, all mine
I'm naturally wired 
Without a shoulder to cry on 
Three dollars, first minute, gosh, man, after that, it cost ya four 
And right down to the knick of time, 
It hurts so much 
Just out of reach.. Oh-oh 
Her thunder thong around your neck.
There must be a better way (ooo-oooh) 
In and out 
U.S. prime, grade A stamped guaranteed 
Searchin' for the light 
Nobody rules these streets at night like me, nobody, ah 
(Oooh) Uh, little dreamer 
Have you ever really touched love once?
Oh, come on, baby, dance the night away. 
Yes I am
Love, love is the source 
Wait like the wind,watch where she blows. 
I heard the wind a whisp'rin', strong magic comin' on! 
You corner my dog, It dont let you past, 
Safe from harm
Sleep and dream is all I crave 
It's you and me ooh
She's good enough, good enough to huh! 
Now I walk like someone else 
I’ve been rich and I’ve been poor.
'Til things get out of control 
Now you're saved by a higher voice 
Don't wanna talk about love 
Same amount, in 'n' out 
(Dancing in the streets)
One man horny, spanked 
Salt shaker, little lick a lime, ohhh 
He's got the look. Top Jimmy, he's the king. 
I know you're in love, so, baby, make up your mind. 
Things you've never realized 
Let's talk, more action, with no distractions 
I wanna hold you and say 
Take a look at this! 
Baby, take me home 
Someday, we'll be 
Right behind the rear-view mirror now. 
It's never gonna stop they'll run ya till you drop 
You take a chance with new beginnings 
Tell a cop, tell a friend, think we hit the stoney end 
But I was young and I was far from lonely. 
You know that you want it, baby, 
Ow
What you need is on the menu and you get it tonight. 
Girl, you really got me now 
Yea they love it when me and the boys 
Now everybody’s suffered
(Show your...) Show it, ow 
I like the way the line runs up the back of the stockings. 
That sweet rhythm,of the road 
just to piss me off?
We can't throw this all away 
A quick stop in the Bulldog 
So this is love? 
And she's comin' she's comin' 
and a buck is all you earn.
I'm your ice cream man, baby, stop me when I'm passin' by 
Oh, please can you shine some light? 
Standin' there....oh 
Sure feels good 
Until I get mine, yeah mine
Just walk away, if I fall shy at all
Where silence speaks as loud as war 
Got me so I can't sleep at night 
See now all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy 
Dealin'....I'm dealin' with these things I'm feelin' 
She wanted something to regret 
Got me all fired up 
I've been thinking about this Saturday night with you 
I wanna love you, maybe set you free. 
I drive just like you!
What they want to see 
So clear your head, find a way home 
Fits paradise to a T 
it's really just the way we sing it. (Sing it:)
Let's do this bottle right. 
Put it out, put it out until Judgement Day 
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Just as long as she drives me home 
you're facing the wrong lane.
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready. 
I can't seem to get her out 
It's what's happening? 
Is that you? 
Whoo! How 'bout 'cha now, 
With the power of deity 
The grass is never greener and there's plenty around 
Yeah, the cradle will rock. 
Of the unforgiven
But all this can't be worth my 
Man, I thought I'd hit the wall 
And it's the final bell for pushing broom. 
Some goes to women, some goes to Jesus, 
Turn and swear 
Just look around, whoa yes 
It's gettin' hard to find 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, one break coming up! 
Felt so much 
Sayin' I can't wait to feel your love tonight, ooh 
Ohh that's what dreams are made of 
And it ain't gonna change without a fight 
Someone cracked the seventh seal 
Get it and jump. Jump!
Ooh, I need your lovin' 
Oh here it comes again 
No one could look as good as you 
A break in this routine 
as in: "must accept as is."
Wired, naturally wired
You can talk to me
Lemme show you, 
Yeah, she's gotta have a soul, 
Ah yes!
No, I don't ask for permission 
She got a doorbell sign:
Every day down here’s a rainy day
Look at all that money, baby 
Somebody get me a doctor.
One more piece of the puzzle, I'm there 
What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money can turn your head around. 
Are you for real, it's so hard to tell, from just a magazine. 
Screaming electric green
So i can make sense of 
All we need is music (sweet sweet) sweet music (sweet sweet music) 
Grab a guy,grab a girl,everywhere around the world. 
Bop bada, shoobe doo wah, whoo 
Baby-yeeaahh
And there's a short supply 
Well, I'm usually passin' by just about eleven o'clock 
Hey ray, what you said is true 
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)
My baby, let me fill you up inside (up inside) 
A year to the day! 
Oh yeah 
I'm all feed up, watchin' tv 
Oh oh oh ooh oh
Don't waste time 
Same old pickup lines 
You know that you want it. 
Well, don't skip romance, 'cause you're old enough to dance the night away. 
Shake it up, pick it out nice, 
It must be good for something 
Ah." 
(Beggin' you baby, beggin' on my bended knees) 
I can't wait to feel your lovin' tonight 
Questions deep within your eyes, 
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', yeah 
And always trust 
Go try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo 
No comin' back, back for more
All you'd need 
Oh, little darling, 
And I say, rock on! 
So come on baby, please
Top Jimmy cooks, Top Jimmy swings. 
(I) said If you're doin' business with me, honey
I can't remember when I was your age 
The one I want!
You're gonna make me crash
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue. 
It's right now 
(I can't wait to feel your love tonight) 
And the dreams in between 
Yeah!
Ev'rybody needs some. 
A little thick in the bottom 
And it left a scar. 
Tell me, what are you waiting for 
Strawman, don't have a leg to stand on 
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme 
Like a hound dog chasing a bird 
Oh say it isn't so, baby 
(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, bay-yeah!)
Ah but ah,she just looking good. 
Yeah, got to got to bleed baby 
Pretty woman.
No borderline in the sand I'd trace 
I'm alive, I'm electric, inspired 
Fire! 
Let's take a walk down easy street 
If you don't know what that means 
How long can this go on 
He's got everything 
Uh, I said I like it 
If I cannot see you from afar 
Turn this thing around
Tell me what you gonna do

They'll find a cure for anything 
I need a change, I need it quick 
You're a nervous wreck.
Mercy! 
Yeah, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble. 
This dream is over, (oooh oooh oh) 
Here we go Around, (round, round, round) 
Got no room to second guess 
Hey, I don't understand
But it's my turn to try 
Cause we may never be here again 
Cause something heached out and touched me 
All you bad bad boys - got one man horny, spanked 
Come on smile and say cheese 
Sandman, kicking mud in your eye 
Or couldn't keep quiet, when she needed a hug 
That makes a woman 
but who returns once again to squeeze you no doubt!
90 days on the road is what I need 
Just like I told you before, before, before 
Walking down a dead end street 
Purple mountains' majesty
She was seaside sittin', just a smokin' and a drinkin' on ringside, on top of the world, oh, yeah. 
This could be like yesterday, 
Hey you, wake up, get yourself together 
And the river runs a little too deep 
Oh, man it's hard enough, yeah.. 
But yesterday I was alone 
That's what's on my mind 
Pretty woman, Oh you look lovely as you could be, 
No matter what they say, I disagree. 
Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad, 
Hold on a second baby 
Yeah, we're all fast breakers comin' out of the gates takin' chances. We're the crash and burn. 
No I can't recall any love at all 
There's no need to be denied 
Hey Eddie 
Now who you're gonna call when you need that special (special) little something 
You're old enough to dance the night away. 
Look around, whoa yeah 
Purple mountain's majesty
I'll just, I'll just love you 
Gonna give it all we got. 
I’m done with coexisting.
Tell ya what it is 
I can shoot a gun in the streets 
Hold on 
Barely a beginner, but just watch that lady go. 
Needed a girl to call my one and only. 
'cause I've tried, yeah I tried for it 
All your dreams are strange, love comes walkin' in 
Oh, I know it won't hurt, 
But now I see how you really are. 
You're both a bunch of suckers 
We're stripped, drawn, and cheated, 
Contact is all it takes 
Feel like throwing in the towel don't be a fool 
We can crash on the beach 
Crank it, blow out 
And then some lovin, wouldn't that be nice, yeah! 
Whoo, Bop bada, shoobe doo wah, bop bada, shoobe doo wah, (ba da whum) 
Panama, Panama
Pumpin' up for the show 
If you take your whiskey... 
We'll see the light 
Now, I'm a seaside sittin', just a smokin' and a drinkin'; 
Might as well jump.
A little more volume in the headphones please...
yes you are in danger.
Top Jimmy and his Rhythm Pigs 
It's only one scene, but to me it don't matter 
Leather,across his thighs, 
Deadman, living for tomorrow 
They're dancing now 
I'm just a sucker for a pretty face
And do it anytime 
Just like I told you before, uh before, uh before, before 
I've been feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin' things that I don't know 
And while she watches I can never be free, such good photography ! 
I, I been dreaming 'bout tomorrow 
Well, I'm sick and tired of cleaning room. 
Get up and make it work 
And if it don't come easily 
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom. 
You don't have to worry about the man 
(This is home) But hear me now, somebody said "Fair Warning, Lord !" 
Yeah you may have all you want, baby, but I got somethin' you need 
I can feel your pain.
Just out of reach, oh-oh 
Face down,

Come on baby close your eyes let go 
Ow, woo, oh, show (show) show your love babe, ah, yeah

Have you ever been touched? 
Claiming victory 
Now showbiz is so thrillin', the camera rolls she's willin' 
Now I know none of this was planned, it all just kinda happened 
My heart, you're breakin' my heart. 
(Show your...) Ow
You say you're lonesome just getting by,
I'm ringside, on top of the world. 
Have you seen her? 
Creatures from the sea with the look to me like she'd like to fool around. 
Nobody rules these streets at night like me, the atomic punk 
(didn't you? didn't you?) 
Yeah, I'm rolling slowly
I must confess 
You and I 
I've been thinking about it all week long 
A fire!
I barely survived 
Hey, got to got to bleed baby 
Until we meet again, 
And I'm sick and tired of golden rules. 
Down in Cabo 
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout the 
(Oooh) Little dreamer, oh yeah, oh

It's everywhere 
Woman, just wanna fly in first class 
Who's it gonna go to? 
Wow-oo-ow-oo-ow! Yeah
Oh! Put it out until Judgement Day 
(Ah) 'take those','need' and 'give all',this much you understand 
In the absence, there's a presence in my heart 
Babe, I said I like it 
Some call it luck, it's all the same 
Baby come on)
Fever starts to climb, reaching 105 (degrees) 
I don't know. Did you tell me? 
They comin' out for sure. 
Hold on, one more 
(hey hey hey hey hey) 
I have your picture, yes I know it well. 
Familiar faces familiar sights 
She's good enough to huh! 
A sucker all dressed up in a 3 piece suit 
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep 
Everyday I watch the tide roll in 
Darkenin' your door 
I want what I wanted 
Makin' plans 's a waste, ain't no future here 
Ooo, Ahhh 
Ooh, yeah....

I just don't want to talk to him now 
Honey, I ain't through with you 
Baby this blows 'em all away 
(Standing on top) Hey darling 
In a word to the wisdom tooth 
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, miles and miles from nowhere 
Up in New york city (Dancing in the streets) 
She decides and you agree, she's leaving 
Some of that big, fat money, alright 
We was sittin' ducks for the police man. 
Yes, I'm living at a pace that kills
Try and figure you out
And it said, "Open my eyes. Leave it all behind." 
it's the meanest blues of all 
Caught a plane outta Moscow 
And I'm alone, I'm on the highway, wanted dead or alive, dead or alive. 
But I ain't home at night 
Just kill the pain 
You see I'm beggin' you please 
Well, I'm feelin' better now that we're through. 
Say it like ya mean it!
Today I am a star and broke.
Yeah, that's it, a little more to the right, a little more.... 
I don't care if you're John Wayne 
The fact from the fancy 
it's no longer me!
I wanna crash on the beach 
How expensive he was
Well he used to go out drinking, 
You better watch your mouth 
Be your own best friend 
Honeybabysweetiedoll You're the one that I want or I don't want one at all.
Ain't got no money, got no house on the hill 
Catch that smile and I hit the roof 
The choice is up to you 
Come back when you're younger
I found the simple life ain't so simple
Love's only to share 
Baby, you got something 
Uncle Danny had a coal tattoo
Model citizen zero discipline 
Heartaches all around me, how many times we cried. 
Splash that holy water on me 
Once it's decided, a line drawn in the sand
Didja get your head lost in a daydream? 
We gotta try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo 
If love has got you down then love can pick you right back up 
Only missed by a fraction, 
The only one I want (the one I want)
hey got you goin' in, they got you comin' out 
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue 
Her movies get down like you won't find in my hometown 
Oh girl, come on 
Wondering if Ive done it wrong, 
Yes, I'm all fired up 
I like to look at the long run
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue
I'll eat with my fingers 
You red hot Florida trailer trash
One thing you must believe 
Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on some of that 
Space station, starvation, premature ejaculation 
If she can't, then nothin' else can 
Give me another cigarette 
I wants to tell ya, 
And she knows she's mine and ain't lettin' go 
And never touch 
A little bit of everything, even when it hurts 
Baby, please!
Seems like forty days and forty nights 
But, honey, if you're needing a woman just as bad as me, you ought to be goin'. 
You got to tell him anything 'cause 
All my life Ive never stopped to worry 'bout a thing, 
Only thing that's on my mind - ah, she's forgotten my attention 
Oh, take me back 
Anytime (ah)
(Ah) He'll make conversation,but she's listening to your cash 
You think you got the int'rest. 
I got a one track mind, my blinders up

Sweet 'n' sour, filiblister 
Tell you a secret to make you think

Once over 
Tryin' to hit the road 
I am a victim of the science age, uh 
Woman, you suffer from a color.
Your's very truly,
I'm all conditioned, what I say 
Summer's here and the time is right,for dancing in the streets, 
but I'm high on luck.
Over and over
I can't tell you what's right for you 
Standing on top of the world, 
Well my telephone was ringing and 
Sexy dragon magic
Sucker. 
Tell me a story 
Ooh, mama, see the firelight. 
Ones like you ain't never seen 
You're doin' all you can to make me sad and blue. 
All the bills are paid. I got it made in the shade, and all I nee, nee, need is the woman. 
My teachers all gave up on me. 
Psst, hey, come on man, wake up. 
If I had it all to do I'd do it just the same. 
Overloaded, baby, I can hardly walk. 
To love somebody honestly 
Babe to make the best of what you havent had, ah yeah!

Hey, hey, hey 
Somethin' to fill in the holes 
Right now, baby I'm alone and I'm swallowing a lot of pride 
And she knows what love is for (ahhh) 
If I had one wish I'd, take it 
You can feel it yeah 
It should mean, a little, a little more (ahhh) 
Wired, naturally wired 
I had a dream it was really you 
When you were last mine 
Her feet are making tracks in teh winter snow, 
I give you my share with no conditions 
Well, that liquor in the nighttime leaves strange memories. 
Around the block, maybe once or twice, 
Yes, I'm searching 
An emancipation, a false proclamation? 
I can't tell you but it lasts forever 
Drive my search engine home.
You got a hold on me
If I cannot hear you from afar 
No, I ain't bitchin' 'bout the things you been puttin' down here in the street 
You're running blind,but she jumps the gun. 
Broken now I can't help but feel 
No, nothing could be further 
Stay until it rolls away 
And I see lonely ships upon the water. 
I brought my pencil 
Never gonna change
If we stand the test of time 
The stakes have never been higher
Everything turns out all right 
She's blinding, I'm flying, 
All I wanna give you woman (Oh)

It burns 
Oh oh oh oh 
Really last 
Spread your wings 
Waiting for someone to come into focus 
Jump back, what's that sound ?

Livin' with the aftershock 
Had me all worked up inside. 
I just don't want to take no calls 
Every riddle 
Creatures from the sea with the looks to me like she'd like to fool around. 
I'm livin' with the aftershock 
And I know you know I got no special plans.

I know how it's gonna be 
Though our circumstances

You got me so I don't know where I'm goin', yeah

On the stage, off my strings, down my face 
Danger in the rearview mirror 
Well alright, oh, big, big money 
Sweet little wishbone, oh yeah 
And now we're wasting time 
If I were you, you were me 
Wanting their piece of the pie 
Ooh, lovin' and a livin' and a treat me like a fool. 
It's got what it takes 
Got politicians smokin' crack 
Kickin' back, ain't kickin' you, no, no

And all over me 
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Ain't gonna tell you what's right for you 
I'm gonna get it all in one big pot (one big pot) 
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb 
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird 
Wont let you past 
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight and I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze. 
Takin' care of the music biz 
Oh wow! Take it off! Take it all off! 
You take an average guy 
Juke-joint Jimmy is the latest thing, he's got the sound that everybody digs. 
And true love will never die 
My, my, my I guess that I never thought she'd walk 
(Oooh) You are the little dreamer 
One more payment, lay it down, on the ground Same amount, in 'n' out 
That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted
No truer words have ever been said 
That we can make it right 
Yeah, I'm walking, don't need no ride 
Of your breath
I broke a heart, simple and true. 
And that is, I'm slowly fading away
but she was cool.
(Ah) Well all your dreams of riches, are based on magazines, 
Cause separation 
Lost in a world, can't find my way home, miles and miles from nowhere 
It’s all happening downtown.
I think I heard an angel sigh. And she said: 
What's there to do tonight, anything? 
How many say I, how many say I 
I'll send the message in a bottle 
Oh,oh,oh she get crazy, 
It's on my back but it ain't my monkey, no 
Have you ever looked down when the homeless walked by? 
Stone you like nothin' else can 
Baby, got to have your love 
Well I'm just trying to figure 
They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away. 
So fine and pretty. Fooled me with her style and ease. 
(Ah) No this aint television,but its more than it seems 
I feel good, so good, so good, so good 
I don't belong to any race 
The menace's loose again 
Yeah 
what does that make you?
Millions of miles, oh no, miles and miles and miles from nowhere 
I'm in a cold sweat 
Whisper in my ear, rest assured that 
Oh, deja vu
Just to love you 
We're not defeated, noooo, 
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now! 
For a little while. 
I wrote a letter and told her these words, that meant a lot to me. 
Damned if I do, and then I'm damned if I don't. 
Standing on broken dreams 
Hey-hey-hey! Oh! 
If I cannot kiss you from afar 
I'll meet you down at the ole fishing hole 
Look at all these little kids 
Your I.Q. plummets fourteen points.
And if I asked you not to try 
I never see them, but they're always on my back. 
My karma just ran over your dogma.
Badness bringing up the rear 
I'm only wastin' time. I think I'd better go. 
Look the same in the mirror 
Don't draw the line 
(Used to be, I couldn't sleep at night, baby 
I tried, I tried, 'til I'm satisfied 
Yes, I better take my chances 
That's just what's expected
That ain't no way to treat the broken-hearted
Land's end, you'd have to see it 
Home grown, way down home, yeah! 
Wah! 
In this town that’s called progress,
Can be held by the same hand
I get up, and nothing gets me down.
Wash away my suffering, oh 
That's how it'll always be 
Headless body in a topless bar.
Well, back in the past when I was treated so coldly, 
She's the woman (Sing it:)
Ma and pa look back on all the things they used to do, 
Are you lonely just lik me 
Oh they got you comin' in, for the same amount 
All you bad bad boys - call her up on the spank line, huh 
I just can't take it! 
Woman get crazy,if she cant go 
Wearin' out my welcome 
You can always have trust in me 
This one blew my mind, oh 
A bitter pill, and an overcast 
I'll tell y'all about it

Fine piece of real estate, yeah

Now, come on!
She's the woman
He's a fighting man, sure enough 
Does not the bit, bridle the horse 
I thought I'd found you once again 
Oh baby we belong in a world that must be strong 
And I think I like, like a hound dog, chasin' a bird
The jury look at me, say, "Outta luck." 
I'm your last loose end. 
She's the woman (Go on:)
They may talk about you cold when you were 
Some kind of alien 
I guess Ill go home,its late,maybe tomorrow night... 
Why behave in public if you're 
Cause we're sick of these four walls 
Never had no money and they always told the truth, 
To love somebody secretly 
All the way, they got you down 
La-la-la-la
So open up and say ahh-men 
Hey, man, that suit is you! 
Can't take it anymore. 
Lookin for direction 
Now you gotta run to get even 
Sound a little bit absurd. Hey! And a little too late
You say that love has got you down well that's bull 
It's enlightened me, right now 
Walkin' the streets doing that ole, the Cabo Wabo 
We don't have to chase it 
Adrrrrr... 
Little by little, gonna get it, I swear 
Memory filling, filling this empty room 
Yesteryear I may be gone 
You know how sometimes,you got to rush, 
That funny feelin again winding me up inside 
I'm telling you, ow 
And don't like me makin future plans 
I want more 
Standing on top.
A man needs love to live, I'm the living proof 
Oh, that's my woman, 
Shine the light on a shadow
She's given me the runaround, yeah, ow! (round, round, round, round) 
Yea, yea, yea..... 
Love of the craft
But we're not defeated, Nooo, sir 
Hooked into her system 
When the rest have packed it up 
One soul, one mind 
Change with a wink of your eye 
I can see you don't know which way to turn,
Fill me up and then I'm satisfied, own me 
But I'm a'comin', back again, yea 
Daddy's little sweetie after some damn rainbow 
Is there anything left in that bottle? 
and I suffered 'cause of you.
Somethin' you feel but can't explain 
Josephina, if I asked you, would you tell me? 
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost in my own pleasure dome 
Say you're gonna leave me cause I only tie you up. 
Don't wanna hear what love can do 
No middleman, 
Slip n' slide, push it in 
Travels light,without a pack,without love. 
Cha........ Yeah!
She's given me the runaround, oh, ow! (round, round, round, round) 
Your bad mood's permanent.
Wow!

Uh just to try to make herself feel better 
Look at me, look at you!
Down to Cabo 
Ooh, I live with fools!
Feelin'....no, don't like what I've been told I'm feelin' 
Feelin' like something's gonna blow 
(oh, women in love) 
Your magic greets everyone who reads. 
Ain't I glad that love is blind? 
Baby, Lover, Angel Face(s), SatinDoll You Straight Up Aces
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, I'm miles and miles from nowhere 
Just one of the mysteries of creation 
As Is is how I follow through.
Heh! 
Oh, but that's not me 
Let me take you down 
We'll be coming back. Don't come running to me. 
Want! Want! Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! 
Yeah, that's the woman, 
Don't you dare start what you cannot finish
Unspoiled by progress,
If I choose, I can take the fall 
The only one I want (the one I want) 
Now I see that all I want... 
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin' 
Broke a heart for someone like you. 
I checked it out. I think you ought to know. 
How many, how many, say I 
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep and he don't come home for half the week. 
On a count of three 
livin' on a playground? 
First you say that you will 
Grow it long, shave it off 
Life is hard, never soft 
But one night's all we're given, so, baby, leave me alone, or, baby, stay the night. 
How about a 9 on a 10 scale 
You turn and swear 
Oh can't you see me standing here,
Ooh, it makes me blue! 
'cause it's always been there
Returning home of the prodigal 
For the distance between us 
She saw the look in his eyes, 'n' she knew better 
Mayday! 
And all I've got I had to steal
Uh, I like it

You know 
It's how you dress 
Oh I.... I... I..... 
For sure Ah 
I've got my back against the record machine
I watch my television; almost lost my mind. 
I think of all the education that I missed. 
A better way (ooo-oooh) of, of passing the time 
Forgotten empires
Whole lotta Shakespeare going on and on and on.
Come on, take a chance. 
Got nobody waiting at home

They break your heart so damn easy

No explanation, just wasting time, yeah 
Somewhere,lost it in a turn

To love somebody equally 
Talkin' some new kicks 
I'll bear that same old cross on Judgement Day 
Uh huh, I never stop, I'm usually passin' by, just around eleven o'clock 
Wanna see my I.D.? Try to clip my wings! 
They won't believe it when they see what they're seein' 
Your iron lung's a bag of wind
They say all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy 
Girl gone bad 
Nothin' lost, tell me, how can I lose 
I got everything you wanted 
I have a apolitical blues and 
I don't wanna find religion 
No Evil Woman got a hold on me.
Uh ha, uh ha, ho 
Right here and now 
One time, boys 
By keepin' the dream alive
One eye on the road, crashed upon his head, 
Wow! Put it out until Judgement Day 
Wax it down now 
Blasting out the night,he's terrified to drive. 
While your back is turned 
Welcome to China Town.
Hey!
Guess I better say my prayers

How many say I, how many say I
The more I look 
Lemme get on some of that, 
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue, 
I'm talkin' some new kicks 
She be headed where the thunder rolls, 
Get your feet back on the ground, 
And then say I love you, but aren't willing to show 
Every clue 
I want some too. 
Oh Lord, I've heard the shotgun 
But not one thing I tried 
See it, oh can you see it?
my other apartment.
This ain't no party, this ain't no show! 
Come on take me down, down, down.... 
Start lookin' in 
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard 
Rich was better, totally better.
In mother earth's soul, yet 
Ahhhhh...
Spread your wings an' open wide (open wide) 
But not all of yours 
Fallen angel looked alot like you 
Wait for the opening 
I just want to feel 
Baby, please! 
And it's all wrapped up in a tight little bundle 
I need more than just words can say 
I can't stop lovin' you, oh 
Feelin' what no one else will ever know I'm feelin', oh.... 
Reach for the golden ring 
All these crazy women, one more crazy night. 
When it's love 
Home grown, and down home, 
Sometimes a certain tom's gotta peep 
love it when he rolls his eyes. 
You never really know 
No light at the end of the tunnel
Where have all the good times gone.
Ah,ah,ah 
And I'm seein' what no one else will ever know I'm seein' 
It'll last forever 
With long legs straight on up to her lunch pail 
Can't survive and think to win.
I gotta have mine, yeah mine
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight, and I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze. 
Oh, love once. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
If everything is going your way
Your husband's comin' home 
Faucet pouring, fresh 'n' bitter 
Rock on!

It's our home 
Now, you go on. Do what you want to.)

Baby, just come on, come on, come on 
Holyman, take me to the promised land
C'mon babe!

Baby, don't get uptight. 
I'm sure that there were times, life could be unkind 
Right now, hey 
I got good lemonade, ah, dixie cups 
But never losing sight 
You put a spell on me
Love takes a little time 
Love 'em all I says.
Still cookin up an old time, long lost recipe 
You can say what you like, it's all confidential, oh 
Is this the one that got away? 
Help me 
Kissing the ground 
So this is love! Well, she finally kissed me. 
He fought for the unions - some of us still do
No distractions, ah, no distractions, I'm on a mission, whew, aw

Some call it fate, some superstition 
Lord I think I found, found, found.... 
I just love 'er keepin' me hanging on, 
Ow! 
When I'm startin' off with nothin' 
Numb my brain 
Sucker all dressed up in a 3 piece suit
Now come on baby
Year to the day! 
(Beggin' you baby, beggin on my bended knees) 
To believe in a miracle 
It's my life, get off my ass, get outta my face 
Unchained, yeah ya hit the ground running 
Oh-ooh somebody tell me 
Dance, dance, dance the night away. 
Yeah dreams come true
Or even suspect it
Is how hard we tried 
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells, look what that does to me. 
And then something crazy happens
Hot summer nights that's my time of the year 
Face down in Cabo 
Blue-eyed murder in a side-swiped dress 
there will be times 
I can't wait to feel your love love love love tonight, aw, wah wah 
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real
Baby how you been?
So dream another dream 
No more growing codependent over you.
Another accomplice slinging dirt 
Leaving here we aggravate you 
One more walk through problems, 
Woo
She's always been there 
She want's to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah 
A moment in time 
Ah, one time 
Uh no, no, no 
Now who's that babe with the fabulous shadow? 
Pizzaman, just wanna slice 
Well are you prepared for your very last breath? 
When love will come or go 
Staring at the sun 
Without you, without you
Straight from my heart oh tell me why 
There must be some kind of way 
Got a hold on me
Put the pedal to the metal 
And you're the one I want (the one I want) 
I'm on fire 
Now look at all of the people here tonight...
I'm stepping over 
Oh yea, uh oh, oh yea 
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world 
Rooms without doors open for me, oh no 
Shes as strong as the mountains,walks tall as a tree. 
Shuttin' down, gotta stop this thing 
Everybody let’s stay focused.
And baby while we at it i’ve had it
Til we meet again some other day 
Honeybabysweetiegirl let me count the ways you rock my world
Though nothing's on the shore 
Now she's working on the street, shakin' poor boys down. 
You got Allah in the east 
I live my life like there's no tomorrow
I just wanna sink my teeth in that 
This can be everything we've dreamed 
Flat stone cold lied to, 
And falls between the cracks 
(Told Ya!)
In mother earth's soul, not yet 
Wanting my pie in the sky 
So autobiographic

This freezin' snow is gettin' really old 
High rise, high rent before it's earned, it's all been spent 
You say you don't know, you won't know until you begin.
And it ain't gonna change, it ain't goin' away, no 
We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come 
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up my choice 
She ain't about to give an inch of ground, no.. 
And in the end on dreams we will depend 
World turns black and white 
He wanted her tonight, ah, and it was now or never 
She got a rainbow that touches her shoulder, 
Get, get, get, get, get out and push 
Til the brown skinned woman,

Heart-break in overdrive

Oh, yeah, right now 
His own church applauds 
Is the best part of a man,Yeah 
Oh, deja vu 
I'm doing the victory dance!
Yeah, you know that you're headed for a lot of trouble. 
I woke up to yet another day 
Keepin' me temporarily satisfied 
There ain't no way 'round the system 
I'm tripping and stumbling across the land, full of miracles 
One ear to the ground,he's listening to the dead. 
Yeah, the one I want (the one I want) 
La-la-la-la-la
You got Jesus in the west 
Just tune into what this place has got to offer 
And I know not what it's like 
I told her, never in hell, no special reason.

The assurance only hope can bring 
Lived a cat named Big Bad Bill, 
Tell me why can't this be love

Ooh, we're comin' out tonight. 
You can't get romantic on a subway line. 
Oh could you let it be 
Looked him in the eye 
Once whoa-oh-oh really touched? 
Go ahead, jump.
And then one night in sunny victory 
Could not recall just where or when 
It's looking like the city towed 
No I... I... I... 
Or felt like mine 
A luckyman don't always know who they are 
Once whoa, really touched? 
Here's to your thin red line 
None of 'em know it 
One light that shines 
Dream another dream, this dream is over, (dream another dream) 
And we don't worry 'bout tomorrow 
There's a sleepy town, south of the Border 
Now black is white and white is black 
Trouble seems to fit him like a glove. 
Oh, we're the lost generation, 
Whiteman, tryin' to get a tan 
Bitch sure got the rhythm 
Than one night stands, whoo 
At the 'leventh hour. I'm goin' back outside. 
The point i'm trying to make

And nothing else could ever do. 
That's right... 
Down at the starting line
It puts me through the roof, yea.... 
Hey fool, wise up, better late than never 
You better call up the ambulance, I'm deep in shock. 
It's all right there 
Summer nights and my radio 
Come on too strong, when a little's too much 
Don't wanna wait til tomorrow, 
Catch that magic moment, and do it right, 
You can feel it 
We think a lot but don't talk much about it

Mommy didnt need no little boys,Wont you tell me,

Please, don't ever let me be 
Well, I been workin' since a ten of nine 
Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same, 
due to budget constraints.
Will you ever be the same? 
I were you and you were me 
In a home-grown, and down home, 
Slipped a little off your pace, oh, 
Got one foot out the door 
Some of that big money 
Light 'em up!
No good, no good, no good. 
Communication Breakdown.
She's so fine 
Traffic is giving you trouble?

You look at every face in a crowd 
The pendulum will swing, swing into power 
Just to try to make herself feel better

Speaking the word of God 
Kickin' down, where to start 
Aaa-ohh Hey you! Who said that?
To love somebody naturally 
No, not fade away 
they told me it was Chairman Mao 
I know about this school. 
Come on, crash on the beach 
I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by 
Like a train runnin off the track 
(This is home) See, a gun is real easy 
Like a tongue on fire, no one can tame
Light up the sky. 
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey) 
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind 
Told ya I was comin' back...
All these token words that you legislate 
They say I'm crazy, from the wrong side of the tracks. 
I'm in love 
Oh! 
Oh, I can't stop lovin' you
No one's got it wired 
Don't tell me what love can do 
Watch the left, watch the right, below

Cookin' up that old time long lost recipe, for me

This ain't groovin', this ain't funky 
A live wire. 
I got more than I wanted, but how is still a mystery 
Whoo! Gimmee. Ah!
Love once? 
I wanna be there with you 
How else am I to know, that all the while 
A self made businessman, 
Then simply pulls a string 
We celebrate when the the gang's all here 
Outta touch most the time 
She kinda took me by surprise 
And when history repeats her hour 
(That ain't no way to treat the broken-hearted)
All seven senses tryin' to deliver 
Oh yeah, ain't talkin' 'bout love 
So very autobiographic

I've fallin' deep into 
Always one more, you're never satisfied 
She'll be gone tomorrow like the silent breeze. 
You got it tough. I've seen the toughest all around.
Somebody get me a doctor. 
It's not who you squeeze
Higher and higher who knows what we'll find 
Cause it's a rip off, 
Stop lookin' out 
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know..... 
What you were like, long before
I learned my lesson, baby. 
Overloaded, down the drain. 
...two...three 
Love, love, love, love is the source 
Ain’t goin’ down to no Crossroads.
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey 
Come on, let me take you down 
No no no no, don't take 'em off, don't take... Leave 'em on, leave 'em on. 
I get on your knees and pray 
Driving me insane 
Yeah, I barely survived
Let the magic do the work for you 
Yeah, yeah 
Well, my baby, she don't want me around. 
Well they got you comin' in, well they got you goin' out 
Nothing left, nothing right 
Jimmy on the radio and even on the video, that baddest cat alive. 
I'm sorry honey if I took you just a little too far, yes 
Come on, feelin' hey, I don't understand these things I'm feelin', no.... 
bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.
I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all 
Feels so nice 
Sucker in a 3 piece suit 
Oh no 
She knows exactly what I need 
So sexy and so frail 
Heaven right here on earth
Don't their bus'ness take good care of me, honey 
I think it's time to roll 
Ow, whoo, woo, show (show) show your love babe, ah, yeah 
Maybe I should go to hell, but I'm doin' well, teacher needs to see me after school. 
Well, you're in our town now.
Slow to forgive, when you're holding a grudge 
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried 
Got the first step down, I know what I want 
I got the tools to satisfy
Ah, Josephina!
Drugged into sin.
Yeah, 
Just (Aaah) sing a song an' think bout sunny weather 
A little low on cash
Yeah they talk about you cold when you were 
Ah, you reach down, between my legs, ease the seat back. 
Got that rhythm,of the road 
Give me everything I want 
Oh, little darling 
Jimmy on the television, famous people laughing with him, 
Just trade in one for the other, 
Pretty woman, I dont believe you it must be true, 
There's a full moon out tonight. Baby, let's begin. 
Turn your radios on, I'll be a right there, yes I will 
Not yours, it's not mine, no 
We made it through the cold 
Speaking cherry red
Touched on that feelin' for an instant 
Go for the action, with no distractions 
You're exactly what the doctor ordered,
It doesnt matter what hat you wear,just as long as you are there, 
Once revealed, can't ever be not shown 
Oh yeah, uh, I got no expections, so get on in the way 
All flavors and push ups too 
It's not that you're hiding 
Preoccupied purely with the physical
I am the ruler of these nether worlds 
Better show, better show your love, now, uh 
Only deeper, year after year, oh yeah, 
When nothing's simple then nothing's learned 
Looking back in anger,the city is rleaved. 
Don't wanna be no uptown fool. 
Don't always believe, all you need is love 
I got Elvis on my elbow
But the sun still shines (senorita)
Take me down, 
'N' so they said goodnight, ah, oh, 'n' now he's gone forever 
Jimmy on the news at five. 
And I want to do that with you babe. 
You put a spell on me-eehh
A flag unfurled, at half mast 
Yeah you corner my dog,It dont let you past, 
Might be something after all 
Any dirty deeds 
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up. 
I gotta have a little taste 
Too many things on my mind 
I'm all conditioned, I'm far off red 
Open up and shout it out,an' never try to sing, 
Oh when it's love 
They want big, fat money 
You'l lose her in the turn. 
The white sand sure makes a tan look nice 
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come on baby
Ah! The ballot or the bullet 
I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead 
There's a fire, fire, fire 
Show me your dragon magic
Gotta, gotta, gotta, get it right 
Here in paradise, you fool 
Looked like a long lost friend 
Ooh, I'm just a pushover 
Piece of the pie 
Lay your bodies down, I'm in your beds, your beds 
Cause I'm two days gone and I just can't see 
Come on 
Oh wow, man ! 
Well I'm a lovin' the horn baby.
Somebody get me a shot.
Like pouring salt on an open wound 
Black and blue, yo mama! 
Easy money, 
The atomic punk
I seen a lotta people lookin' for a moonbeam. 
Dropped, chopped, Alabama chrome.
Man, I thought I'd seen it all 
Stone me like nothin' else can 
And she said: I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble. 
Bad for damn near everything 
In my imagination 
You know I'm beggin' you baby 
Change, and nothing stays the same 
And I'm speedin' down that line. 
Oh no, no, ah 
Press against your lips, taste the sweetness 
They don't remember the place, but they remember the face, and now everybody wanna go. 
All the words on the wall 
Now all I gotta do is get up, go out an' get her 
Blowin' steam 
Under darken skies 
Baby, I could let it slide
Mama, I can be both of them
We can come to terms 
She aint waiting til she gets older, 
Baby, gotta feeling, oooh oooh, 
He comes from nowhere,returns on his own, 
I guess you are 
I know what it is. 
Neighbors gettin' crazy 'bout the noise next door 
His platform could I endorse 
Now, listen here, honey 
I listen to too much rock 'n' roll. 
I know 
All about yours truly 
Bad for the heart, bad for the brain 
That's all I need 
Send the mayor down in his pickup truck. 
S'got me all fired up 
Right on time, you will arrive
Trust in the mercy of the sea 
Just trying to please all the time 
Love, love is the source
That we can work it out
Ah the cat was rough and tough and would strutt his stuff 
Show, come on and show your love, ah, yeah 
And now I'm gonna lose it 'cause that 
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see
Mmmm, you got to got to bleed baby 
Uh, uh ha, uh ha ho, yeah 
God must love the lazy
C'mon turn, turn this thing around 
I been to the edge, an' there I stood an' looked down 
Seems the old folks who come up short were the pretty little kids who didn't want it, no. 
I was in love, but Cupid missed me. 
Be the sacrifice 
And I’ll tell you what I’m getting rid of next:
You wanna sucker 
I'm here standing still 
Come back to your senses, baby 
Guess I knew it all along 
Hey man, anything's alright. Yeah! 
Got to have it 
Baby just spread your wings 
The song ain't dirty
Can't get away 
Gimme big, fat money 
It's a world of fools
I'm just a red-blooded heterosexual
Hey! This is mine 
Got to know why can't this be love 
The harder the better 
Go on and say yes, and really mean no 
Uh ha, uh ha, ho, yeah 
Man, I don't see no problem 
But what I do know I know feels only natural 
You don't want that sugar daddy, not over me 
Once first, once can't ever be not everlast
So take me down to the virgin spring 
No longer are we the minority
I don't know 
Whoa-ooh-oh oh, can you tell me? 
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Yeah, there is a way with beauty, but you never gave a love cross the line where none return. 
Mine, all mine 
Man on a mission, straight ahead 
And nothing falls into place, no 
Ooh, well a sayin' that you're leavin', I don't wanna hear that talk. 
Out on Meanstreet 
You really got me 
I'm a face grenade with the sex pin pulled
Three sixty-five! 
but I'm ahead of you.
I thought I saw you in the distance 
Nothing sacred, nothing left unturned 
Since someone used my first name 
C'mon what's it all about? 
Baby, how 'bout you? 
No way to get free 'n' clear 
Wash it out with soap. Yeah! 
But still lookin' alright, yeah 
I'm seein' 
Smoke this, eat that my ol' lady's gettin' fat 
Let's go! 
I see it rolling out of you 
If you go there once, you'll be there twice 
Shinin' red and blue light 
Ah now summertime's here babe, need somethin' to keep you cool 
And I'm alone, I'm on the highway, wanted dead or alive, dead or alive.
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
Then it's 3-6-9 times 
I thought it was the last
Come on baby, show your love 
Oh, yeah 
I don't care about the way that ya treated me 
She get crazy if she cant go 
Oh! Have you ever been touched? 
If you take your whiskey home.
Wolves at my door wised up quick. 
That's how it goes...
let’s have some funzo.
Waitin' for love to rescue me 
I can jump 
It's a small change 
was worth exploring.
And then they voted you 
Get on your knees and pray 
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed. 
You and your blues.
Yeah it's up to me 
Ow (Show your love) 
Broken down and dirty, dressed in rags a from the day my mama told me, "Boy, you pack your bags." 
Come on, baby 
Oh oh oh ooh
I can almost taste it 
though I'm absolutely certain both's all right. 
Well they got you goin' in, they got you comin' out 
Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no. 
I'll get hung up on the line 
And the cradle will rock. 
How do I know when it's love 
One thing for certain, you're gettin' nothin' free 
Built up, and stand in our way ,ah 
That's what I want 
I want a run for my money, that's all 
Some days you're the dog,
Pretty woman give your smile to me 
Tried a little bit of everything 
Now they believe it, now that they've seen it 
Oh, oo-ow-oo-ow-oo-ow!
Needed someone to love and hold me. 
Inside of me
It's not so easy to find, no 
All you bad bad boys - call her up on the spank line, uh, whoa, aw 
Except for, for a subtle change 
Have you ever really touched love 
Got a pocket full of money 
Come on, get it, get it
Say live and let live, so quick to judge 
Obsessed with this feeling, I trusted it, so I followed it 
But I've tried, yeah I've tried for it 
Tell me what you gonna do 
That's right. 
Bobbed his hair 
I'm tired of hearing what love can do 
And it ain't gonna change without a fight, no 
And the joint been jumpin' when the band been pumpin' and you know they're playing crazy gigs. 
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs 
Hang 'em High. 
Will this depression last for long,wont you tell me, 
I'm tellin' you, ow 
When love comes around 
I got a drink in my hand; I got my toes in the sand. 
Good, good, good enough 
I barely survived
I got the tools. I'll satisfy ya
Oh, mama, fill my cup up. 
Score me some heroin 
yours in a simple rhyme. 
All I need is a beautiful girl. 
Come the daybreak, come the morrow, 
Here she comes, full blast and top down. 
In my little black book 
with you and your blues.
You've got to run to win an I'll be damned if 
Love comes walkin' in 
She looks so fuckin' good 
Times you cried 
Except what I really need 
I'm your wave-tossed guy
Dream another dream, this dream is over, (oooh oooh oh) oh 
Telling me there's company 
Ain’t no Midnight Train To Georgia
But right now baby, I don't really wanna see your face yeah, and that's a fact 
Soon you'll see my silhouette 
Won't recognize them any more. 
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop nice white teeth, Betty Boop. 
Well, my baby's on the corner and she's lookin' so fine 
That's when push comes to shove 
I still love my baby's Poundcake 
And I can't get free (senorita)
that’s how we do biz.
Lost, lost
I heard the news baby, all about your disease 
Tell you what love can do 
Stone cold, sugar daddy 
Now that I've found you: 
I like to open up with a little six on the half shell 
And it ain't going to change, it ain't going away 
Some desert island off Morocco 
So come on baby
I want my control back, but I'm afraid, I'll lose that feeling 
Say what 
C'mon,it's everything 
Love that woman,heart and soul 
Dream another dream, oh, this dream's all over (dream another dream) 
Question is,not does love exist,but when,she leaves,where she goes. 
It's not what you are 
Yeah you, you know that nothing lasts forever 
Hold you in my arms, keep you warm and 
Quiet contemplation 
All other girls, they'd be put to shame 
This is Meanstreet 
We came here to entertain you 
And all I can remember 
Yeah, I've been in debt, from conception 
The more things you get, the more you want, 
You don't have to die to go to heaven 
And when I need something to soothe my soul, 
Gotta lotta things on my mind 
Ah, have you ever really touched 
She made her mountains sing. 
Now gimme, gimme, gimme 
Then turn and swear 
Make me feel good
That's one thing I've learned from the guys 
Once sown, once can't ever be not reaped
It ain't once upon a time 
Class dismissed
When it's love
I want to live so let me die 
And I know what I got to do 
I've known you for all of mine 
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.
Spring a leak 
Bom-ba-dee-da-Bom-ba-dee-da 
It's a major violation, carried away for sure 
Yes I am.
Salesman, try and sell you his soul 
Throwin' down, down tryin' to reach the bottom 
Gimme some of that, 
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls 
When there's only one under the sun 
See, I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all 
Just tell me where to begin cause I never ever 
Then chow down 
Just hangin' 'round the local parking lot 
Once shared, can't ever be separate 
Stone soul sistah soccer mom, muchacha-miga, cherry bomb
Searching for their slice of heaven 
Gonna pack your bags and leave this house of pain. 
That's what I'm talkin' about 
Oh can't you see what I mean?
No talk, more action, I got no distractions 
A dirty water dog 
Going wide, running long, feeling lost 
Give me liberty or give me death 
I need some sympathy
All I know 
Well you ain't been living till you've seen the living thing, 
Listen baby... ooh, ow, ow, uhh.... 
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout those 
Now they all call him sweet pappa Willie dear, 
Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam 
I'm overloaded baby, I say "Bye-bye!"
Rack a what 
Oh! I'm incomplete uh!
Now they want a bigger bite 
We'll do it 'til we're black and blue 
Everybody wants some 
Uh too too far 
I've always liked those kind of high heels too. You know, I... 
You're not a stranger 
Well,way down yonder in Louisville, 
Yesterday I saw my love light shine 
Bad for the rock, bad for the roll 
Yeah, when I see you and your little guitars sing to me
I'm the one the one you love 
loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!
(Come on baby finish what ya started)
Little bit of luck never hurt no one 
She don't like the way I wear my hair 
Can't comprehend the meaning of the metaphysical 
Take me back 
I'd rather leave that to your so-called intellectual 
It means everything 
(It) requires a degree of acceptance
But it takes me at least halfway to the label 
So this is love?
Uh, I'm a man on a mission, straight ahead 
Trouble by the dozens
I'm bleedin'...like no one else will ever know I'm bleedin' 
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can. 
Love hurts sometimes 
The sword or the pen 
She had her drink in her hand; she had her toes in the sand and whoa, what a beautiful girl, ah, yeah. 
Only to surrender 
All you bad bad boys - one man horny, spanked, bad bad bad boys 
Ouch 
And the earth returns to what it was before 
You know you're semi-good lookin', and on the streets again 
Its all sex without love 
(Ah) Senorita do you need a friend?
When he walked by they all held their breath, 
I'm fundamentally for the individual 
Run, run, run, away 
So when you sense a change 
Cause thats what love is made of
Ev'rybody needs some.
In my imagination
Every time I bloomed again
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight. 
And if you let me cool you one time, you'll be my regular stop 
There's still some fight in me 
Good, good, good enough ohhh!
It feels so nice, so nice 
Once, once felt, once felt 
Temporarily pacified 
And I heard bells ringin' 
Yes, she knows she's mine and ain't lettin' go 
Or another man's opinion 
'N' I'm hangin' ten now baby, as I ride your sonic, ooh wave 
Aah-yeah
Poundcake 
At night I walk this stinkin' street 
Lazy eyes in the summer heat, fresh from outta town. 
You know my heart is true, oh 
This next part should really confuse things.
Got me a brand new number 
Filled me up inside 
We're stepped on an' cheated, 
Don't need to talk about love 
Freedom, never had no room for cowards
It's ok, I'll do what I want 
The one I want! 
Next episode begins and begins and begins and begins.
Oh, I wanna touch it,now, oooh oooh oooh, 
And baby I know what it's worth 
San Francisco way, (Dancing in the streets), they do it everyday now, 
Great is the forest, set by a small flame 
I think I need a shot of your love 
Too bad and I can't help you
Wooo-oooo 
Gimme some of that, whew! 
You got to have it quick (got to have it quick) 
Something that's mine, all mine, all mine 
Pigtails and painted toes 
We'd double check but you keep on walking 
I, I'm naturally wired 
If I cannot touch you from afar 
Into a world so far from home, miles and miles from nowhere 
Lord don't let me drown, drown, drown, drown 
Cry! Put it out until Judgement Day 
Dig those moves, vam-pire set me loose, get it higher. 
Fire, fire, fire 
I ain't the worst that you've seen.
If I'm right, yeah you're gonna deal with it 
You can change your mind 
See it's greater than everything 
I wonder who I'd wanna be 
Pretty woman dont walk away, yeah, ok 
There'll be dancing,dancing in the streets. 
No, I ain't gonna tell ya what's right for you 
If I'm right, yeah you're gonna hear about it 
Oh Girl, you really got me now 
For a little while 
And I don't wanna hear what love can do 
Ready, set, go! 
So come on 
Oh, it's a rip off, 
Always love you tender but you only like it rough. 
Gotta get lucky gotta get that done 
Once believed, can't ever lose faith 
Fatman, he's ordering seconds 
Change, nothing stays the same 
yours in a simple 
Why put it off another day? 
And do you really, really drive this way
My conscience loves to stick around 
I tell myself 
Bear my cross just like Jesus Christ 
And you beat it out of town 
Uh, come on!
Give me truth 
Those colors fading to grey 
Catch that magic moment, do it 
Better make up your mind
All you bad bad boys - just call her up, call her up 
Seein'... I'm seein' things that I don't know I'm feelin' 
Whoa yeah, wow 
To change your life to lose your place in time 
Found that girl with a lonesome John, but she should've been with me. 
With the blues 
Do you have to hear me say 
#NAME?
With the conviction of the unseen 
Rudder of ship, which sets the course 
Come on baby, take me home 
Gotta get it while you got it 
(make up your mind) 
When a house is divided, it just will not stand 
Forked tongue in double speak 
Mmmnnnnmmmmmm dup dup mmmnnnnmmmmm 
Let's give it all we got, oooh oooh 
Take me
Yeah, yeah livin' with the aftershock 
Dream another dream, this dream is over, (oooh oooh oh) 
You're no good, no good, no good. 
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye, never say die 
Big, big money, gimme, gimme, gimme 
I just wanna hear you say 
Yea, yea, yea 
I only wanna be by your side 
Blackman, he lookin' for justice 
Give it a try. 
So right down to the bottom of the top (ooh ooh) 
Slip in a dream or two 
C'mon and take the time. 
King-size repercussions
Unchained, and ya hit the ground running 
Hot damn, roll an Amsterdam 
Yeah, hey, yeah!! 
Could this turn tragic? 
Crazy days gone by 
Mmmm, so if you want it got to bleed for it baby 
I am aware the ball might roll or tumble 
Yes, the cradle will rock. 
Got a bad lil' woman, gon' bite yo' ass 
The love in me is never straight and narrow 
Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm,
